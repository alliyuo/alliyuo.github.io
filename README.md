As someone deeply interested in data and the stories it tells to inform decisions—whether in shaping policies or designing physical products—this class has provided an opportunity to explore data from a new perspective. Before this class, I hadn’t fully considered that data could be represented by more than just numbers. Realizing that data encompasses a wider range of representations expanded my understanding of its significance and the myriad ways it shapes our world. This course, in particular, encouraged me to engage with data in unconventional forms, such as archives of personal stories and crafts, which I might have overlooked as I grew up.

Through diverse experiences, including a workshop on cassette making and a project about Jimmie O in the Eastern State Penitentiary archives, I discovered that narratives—whether personal or collective—add critical depth to our understanding of data. Each assignment highlighted the versatility of storytelling as a form of data representation. For instance, Jimmie O’s narrative within the Eastern State archives revealed the duality of being collateral damage in the U.S. penal system while simultaneously providing joy and camaraderie for others within it. Similarly, the narrative from the cassette-making workshop showcased how an individual’s interaction with a medium can transform it into something deeply personal and meaningful. For example, as someone passionate about Afrobeats, I took the opportunity to add my own interests into a craft I would not typically pursue. These experiences underscored the human element—personal stories, emotional connections, and individual experiences—that enriches data, giving it layers of meaning far beyond technical or statistical dimensions.

This idea connects directly to Boud’s argument in *Democracy’s Data* that data holds hidden stories that can be uncovered by learning how to interpret it. The latter part of his assertion—about the importance of learning—resonated with me, as I realized that my earlier understanding of data was constrained by unfamiliar formats. Recognizing and contextualizing data in less conventional forms requires deliberate effort, which this class encouraged me to develop. This approach broadened my perspective and allowed me to appreciate the variety of ways data exists and communicates.

Another significant theme that emerged in this class was the ethical considerations involved in working with certain types of data, particularly archives. Early in the semester, we read *The Ethics of Digital Data on Convict Lives*, which emphasized the challenges of digitizing and presenting historical criminal justice records. Throughout the semester, projects like Printing in Prisons and the Eastern State group project reinforced that ethical considerations are not merely theoretical; they are vital responsibilities. Handling sensitive data, especially involving marginalized or vulnerable populations, requires a commitment to respecting dignity, avoiding retraumatization, and navigating power dynamics. For instance, when presenting Jimmie O’s experience, I had to carefully consider how to represent his story without projecting my own biases or assumptions. This project illuminated how archival data can either perpetuate harmful narratives or offer a platform for understanding complex human experiences, depending on how it is approached.

These ethical considerations and the emphasis on the humanization of data connected naturally to the external workshops I attended, particularly the cassette-making and pop-up card workshops. While the themes of ethics and storytelling were central to the class assignments, the workshops introduced an additional dimension: how hands-on, tactile engagement can offer alternative ways to interact with and understand data. These workshops demonstrated that data is not just an abstract concept to be analyzed; it can also be an interactive, physical process that engages multiple senses and reveals unexpected insights through direct manipulation.

In the cassette-making workshop, for instance, the act of creating a recording medium became a form of data generation in itself. Threading the tape, understanding the principles of magnetic recording, and constructing a physical medium for sound preservation transformed me from a passive consumer of information into an active participant in its creation. Similarly, the pop-up card workshop illustrated how creative construction can represent data. Each fold and cut represented a calculated transformation of a two-dimensional surface into a three-dimensional experience, embodying a complex system of design and meaning. These workshops illuminated data as dynamic and interactive rather than static, further emphasizing its vast potential.

Reflecting on these experiences, I realized how they expanded my understanding of what data can be. Data is not confined to spreadsheets or charts; it can take unexpected forms, from crafts to narratives, each offering unique insights. This realization challenged me to approach data with more creativity and openness, embracing its multifaceted nature.

This class has fundamentally reshaped my understanding of data by encouraging me to explore it in unconventional forms and contexts. It has shown me that data is not merely about analysis or measurement; it is a tool for shaping narratives, driving decisions, and uncovering insights that create meaningful change. These experiences have reinforced my desire to pursue a career in data analysis and international development. I now see data as a bridge, capable of connecting diverse stories, addressing complex challenges, and fostering impactful solutions. This newfound perspective has been both inspiring and motivating, solidifying my commitment to mastering data as a tool for transformative impact.
