## Looking Forward
After this class I’m excited to continue exploring the dynamic nature of data and how it shapes the world around us. Moving forward, I plan to take three key steps to integrate these insights into my future learning career path.

First, I will seek out courses that delve deeper into the intersection of data and storytelling, such as *Big Data, Education, and Society* or *Data Analysis for Social Impact*. These classes will equip me with the skills to represent and work with complex narratives through innovative format while staying true to their underlying meaning.

Second, I want to explore the ethical implications of working with data further by reading books like *Weapons of Math Destruction* by Cathy O’Neil. This will help me think critically about the broader societal impact of data and ensure that my future work is both responsible and impactful.

Finally, I will try to actively build a network of people who are passionate about using data for good. This includes getting involved with the **Data Driven Discovery Initiative** workshops or events they host. I also hope to continue my involvement with **DevLabs** and hopefully apply the skill sets I have gained from this class to ongoing projects there. By collaborating with like minded individuals and contributing to real world initiatives, I can deepen my understanding of how data can drive impactful change. Building this network will not only expand my perspective but also provide opportunities to learn from others who are equally committed to leveraging data for meaninging solutions. I want to surround myself with individuals who inspire and challenge me to think beyond my immediate perspective.

These steps are grounded in the themes and skills I have developed in this class and will lay the foundation for me to grow as someone who sees data as a tool for meaningful change.
